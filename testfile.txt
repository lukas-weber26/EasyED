Thinngs to consider when making ed:
-q to quit 
-w to write (make sure to have an output message)
-make ed filename open a file. Add a prompt by default
-a should add a line and go in insert 
-enter period (ends a comand), puts your ass back in propmpt mode after editing 
-in ed ,p prints out the doc. maybe just make this p
-actually it does 1,$p meaning print from one to last
-n does a print with line numbers, works like p
-n with nothing else prints out your current line number 
- +1p should print one above the current 
- 4c changes line 4. 
- I guess d works like c except just deletes the line (carefull, this has to refigure out all the lines)
- u does undo
-2t0 copy 2 to zero 
-2m0 move 2 to zero
-/This gives you the line with the first instance of This 
-Repeating /This will send you to the next - maybe add a way to make the search go backwards too. Maybe make it just search all and print out all relevant line numbers 
-(start),(end)g/re/p will print out all lines with re one the appropriate line numbers
-(start),(end)s/e/d will replace all e with d
-note that usually re and e would be regex matches but I don't want to do regex right now 
-w for write ie save
